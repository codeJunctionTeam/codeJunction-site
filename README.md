## Reporting Issues
We use GitHub Issues as the official bug and new feature tracker for the Official codeJunction website. 

These are the steps you must follow when you are going to report a bug or suggest a new feature to the project.
1. Go to the issues tab.
``` https://github.com/codeJunctionTeam/codeJunction-site/issues```
2. Click "New Issue" Button.
3. Then you will be prompted a menu with options as "Bug report" and "Feature request".
4. You can select either option based on the bug or feature you are going to report as an issue.
5. After selecting the relevant option, provide a title for your issue.
6. Next step is to fill out the template with accurate information about the bug or feature.

Here are some advices for our users that want to report an issue:
1. Providing us reproducible steps for the issue will shorten the time it takes for it to be fixed.
2. Some issues may be browser specific, so specifying in what browser you encountered the issue might help.
3. If it is a new feature, try to explain it in a manner in which the reader would be able to get a fair understanding about it.
